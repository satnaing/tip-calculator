## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with TypeScript

### What I learned

I built this app with ReactJS along with TypeScript for type checking. Besides, I implement something that I've stayed away for so long, which is testing. Yes, I normally don't integrate testing in my projects. But now, I've learned how to implement testing with Jest & React testing library in this React project. For Continuous Integration, I chose CircleCI. I also use Netlify for Continuous Deployment.
